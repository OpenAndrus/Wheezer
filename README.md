# What is it?
Our device measures the exhalation flow rate via the pressure drop through a venturi. Based on the venturi dimensions, the fluid density, and the pressure drop, the flow rate can be calculated and integrated for the total lung capacity. This information is plotted on a digital display on the device and is also transmitted via bluetooth to a connected android device.

To avoid the lower resolution of the Arduino 101*, we needed to use a differential pressure sensor with i2c communication. We chose to use the SM5812 because it was affordable and had the option to output data over i2c or its analog output. We wanted our device to be portable, so we chose a 3.7V 500 mAh battery from Adafruit. The SM5812 needs to have 5V, so we chose the Powerboost 500c charger in order to boost the battery voltage. The Powerboost 500c charger also has the capability to charge the battery, which is super aweosome. To turn on and off the device, there is a switch between EN and ground on the PowerBoost 500 charger. When we started the project, the 1.44" TFT LCD Display was going to perform the realtime graphing operations for the data; however, we ended up deciding to switch to performing the realtime operations on an Android device through Bluetooth (which kind of defeats the purpose of the LCD.) This switch allowed us to fully use the arduino 101's BLE. An important note on the LCD: If you want to control the Backlight, you'll need to hook the LITE pin up to a PWM pin on the Arduino 101. I chose not to, which can clearly be seen in the schematic. The purchasing links are in the BOM section.

*The arduino 101 operating voltage is 3.3V, thus the analog input pins go from 0 to 3.3V. That cuts off everything over 3.3V that a 5V sensor would output. You can scale the a voltage output to fit the 3.3V cut off; however, we found that i2c was the simplest method that would require the least components.

We ordered our PCB from SEEEDStudio*. We were debating on whether or not to provide the routing and GERBER files on Github; we ended up deciding not to because the SM5812 has become an obsolete component.
